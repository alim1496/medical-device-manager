### Project Description
The project has been developed using `react js` with `typescript`. The design has been done with `scss`. All the source code is bundled to js files using `webpack` which is a very popular bundler. Most of the files having `tsx` extensions heavily rely on scrict type checking. `Functional Components` have been used to develop user interfaces. Third party dependencies like [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) have been used for react support and rendering output with design. For typescript support [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) dependency is used. To give routing support [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) is used. For making http requests like `get`, `post` [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used. [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) is used for `scss` support.
